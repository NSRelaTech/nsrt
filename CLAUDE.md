## Project Overview

Novi Sad Relational Tech (NSRT) — community tools crafted by, with, and for Novi Sad residents. Inspired by the [Relational Tech Project](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/) and their [Remix Library](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/remix).

This is an early-stage project. No stack has been chosen yet. The repo currently contains project description and tool ideas.

## Design Principles

When building tools for this project, follow these principles:

- **Neighbor-to-neighbor, not citizen-to-government.** Strengthen bonds between residents, not reporting tools for authorities.
- **Village-scale, not city-scale.** Scope tools to a block, building, or mesna zajednica.
- **Interoperable small tools over one platform.** Use shared feed formats so tools can publish and consume local data independently.
- **Remix, don't reinvent.** Adapt existing RTP patterns to Novi Sad's context.
