# Novi Sad Relational Tech (NSRT)

Tools crafted by, with, and for Novi Sad residents — made to help us connect, care for, and trust each other.

Inspired by the [Relational Tech Project](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/).

## What is relational technology?

Relational technology refers to digital tools that strengthen local connections and community bonds. Rather than one-size-fits-all platforms, these are tools built with deep awareness of the specific challenges and opportunities in our community.

## Why Novi Sad?

Novi Sad has a rich cultural fabric and engaged residents, but like many cities, could benefit from better tools for neighborhood connection, resource sharing, and collective action.

## Getting Involved

This project is open to anyone who lives in or cares about Novi Sad. Whether you're a developer, designer, organizer, or simply a curious neighbor — there's a place for you here.
