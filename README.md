# Novi Sad Relational Tech (NSRT)

Tools crafted by, with, and for Novi Sad residents — made to help us connect, care for, and trust each other.

Inspired by the [Relational Tech Project](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/) and their [Remix Library](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/remix) of remixable community tools.

## 🏘️ First Tool: Dear Neighbors

**[Dear Neighbors](https://github.com/Citizen-Infra/dear-neighbors)** is the first NSRT tool available for use — a Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a neighborhood dashboard. Community-curated local news links and participation opportunities, scoped to your city and neighborhood.

**[Download latest release](https://github.com/Citizen-Infra/dear-neighbors/releases/latest)** (.zip for all platforms)

Features:
- Pick your country, city, and neighborhood (111 countries, 340+ cities)
- Browse and share community links, vote on what matters
- See local participation opportunities (deliberation sessions, conversations, meetings)
- Filter by topics (urban planning, transport, culture, environment, etc.)
- Dark mode, works in Chrome and Brave

## What is relational technology?

Relational technology refers to digital tools that strengthen local connections and community bonds. Rather than one-size-fits-all platforms, these are tools built with deep awareness of the specific challenges and opportunities in our community.

## Why Novi Sad?

Novi Sad has a rich cultural fabric and engaged residents, but like many cities, could benefit from better tools for neighborhood connection, resource sharing, and collective action.

## Principles

- **Neighbor-to-neighbor, not citizen-to-government.** The goal is strengthening bonds between residents, not building reporting tools for authorities.
- **Village-scale, not city-scale.** Tools scoped to a block, building, or mesna zajednica — not all of Novi Sad at once.
- **Interoperable small tools over one platform.** Inspired by RTP's [Neighborhood API](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/remix) concept — a shared feed format that lets many small tools publish and consume local data (events, assets, needs, plans).
- **Remix, don't reinvent.** Start from existing patterns (see [RTP Remix Library](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/remix)) and adapt them to Novi Sad's context.

## Tool Ideas

### Neighbor Stories & Connection

1. **Priče Komšija** (neighbor stories) — A platform for collecting and sharing personal stories from residents. Who lives on your street? What's their story? Builds connection through narrative, not transactions.

2. **Komsiluk Hub** (komšiluk = neighborhood) — A hyperlocal hub for a specific block or building. Asks, offers, notices, care coordination. Scoped to your immediate neighbors — not a city-wide feed.

3. **Dvorište Sessions** (courtyard sessions) — Organize and discover casual neighborhood gatherings (courtyard coffees, block parties, shared meals). Lower barrier than "events" — more like open invitations with optional microgrants to cover costs.

### Sharing & Mutual Aid

4. **Pozajmi** (borrow) — A catalog of things neighbors are willing to lend (tools, books, camping gear, kitchen equipment, party supplies). Track what's available and who has it.

5. **Razmena** (exchange) — Skill and time exchange where residents list what they can teach/share and what they'd like to learn. Guitar lessons for help with taxes, Serbian practice for English practice. No currency — just matching.

6. **Solidarity Network** — Coordinate mutual aid during heat waves, cold snaps, or Danube floods. Who needs help? Who can provide it? SMS-based with tag groups so you can reach the right neighbors without an app.

### Local Culture & Economy

7. **Kulturni Radar** — A community-owned calendar of small cultural events across Novi Sad (gallery openings, book readings, jam sessions, theater). Neighbors post their own events rather than an aggregator scraping Instagram.

8. **Lokalno Prvo** (local first) — A community-curated directory of local businesses, craftspeople, and services. Neighborhood recommendations with personal context, not anonymous reviews.

### Infrastructure

9. **Neighborhood API (Novi Sad)** — A shared, open feed format for local events, assets, needs, plans, and notices. Different tools publish and consume from it, so the ecosystem stays interoperable rather than siloed.

10. **Community Apps Dashboard** — A directory of all NSRT tools and other community-built digital resources. The front door for residents who want to find or build tools.

## Getting Involved
